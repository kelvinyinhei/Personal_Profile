Run-time Analysis:


Task0: 
- It runs two times on reading two csv files in linear time
	- O(2n + 2) 
	~ Approx. O(n) 



Task1:
- Two loops for reading two csv files in linear time and two for loops to store phone numbers into one list
	- O(4n) 
	~ Approx. O(n)



Task2:
- There are no loops in the function 	
	- Approx. O(1)



Task3:
- Two loops for reading two csv files 
	- which is O(2n)

- For Part A
	- There is mainly one for-loop
	- Approx. O(n)

- For Part B
	- there are two for-loops and searching in if-case
	- O(n^2) in worst case
	- Approx. O(n^2)



Task4:
- For line 22 to 26, its a for-loop and "set" the list
	- O(n + 1)

- For line 29 to 31, its for-loop and a searching in if-case
	- O(n^2) in worst case

- For line 34, its a sorting 
	- Reference: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-time-complexity-of-the-Python-built-in-sorted-function
	- O(nlogn)

- Total: O(4n + 4) + O(3*n^2) + O(nlogn)
	~ Approx. O(n^2)
