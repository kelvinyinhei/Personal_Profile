1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,169
So now, I'm officially proud of you.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,549
You've done a great job building Google Maps.

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,750
I wish you'd been around 15 years earlier when Google Maps didn't exist,

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,349
then you could have built a company and sell it to Google.

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,404
But, great.

6
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:14,480
This is a great accomplishment.
